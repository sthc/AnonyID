# Open Project of Anonymous Identity (OPAI)

The goal of the Open Project of Anonymous Identity (OPAI) is to privide everybody (and everything) with an identity that can be used for authentication universally online. The identity is self-contained and fully separated from the real ones, hence called **Anonymous Identity (AnonyID)**. It perfectly protects privacy and will serve as the base for an _unified virtual society in cyberspace_ that is parallel and contrast to the one in the physical world.

The operations of AnonyID are based on the crytocurrency [Soothing Coin (STHCOIN/STHC)](https://soothing.center). While the AnonyID system is being developed, you are encouraged to get as many STHCOIN as you can. In this [forum post](https://oracle.soothing.center/t/how-to-participate-and-get-sthc/467), you can find tips to get the coins.

For the details, download the latest version of white paper in [Releases](https://github.com/sthc/AnonyID/releases).

This repo is dedicated to the documentation of the project including

* White paper
* Protocols 
* Pseudo code
* Implemention specifications
* Research articles
* References
* Contracts and agreements
* ... and so on. 

Let's get started on building a "parallel universe"!
